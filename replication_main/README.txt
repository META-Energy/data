This is the readme file for the replication package for the Stata commands in
Gechert, S., Mey, B., Prante, F., Schäfer, T. (2025): The Price Elasticity of Heating and Cooling Energy Demand, https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/4sjy5_v1 
see the full documentation here: https://github.com/META-Energy/data 

 1.	To replicate the tables and figures in Stata, simply run the metaenergy_estimation_main_final.do which uses the metaenergy_final.dta 
2.	This will produce all content in the subdirectory ../output/. If you want to use a different directory structure, be sure to change the directories in the .do file
3.	If you use other software, you might need to use the alternative .xlsx files of the dataset. metaenergy_final_fromstata_labels.xlsx features the label values of all categorical values as strings. metaenergy_final_fromstata_values.xlsx features the category numbers. 
4.	Please contact us if you have any questions or find errors. sebastian.gechert@wiwi.tu-chemnitz.de
