Households use fuel as input to produce energy services, such as cooking. In general, aordability, accessibility, and the convenience of the fuel inuence the consumption decision of households. However, in developing economies with high penetration of clean fuels, such as Brazil, it is understood that the main determinant is the aordability. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the household demand for liqueed petroleum gas (LPG), taking into account the recent Brazilian social and economic changes. We apply static and dynamic models for panel data at the states level from 2002 to 2018, the period after the fuel price deregulation in the country. Our results suggest that the own-price, food price, income, and temperature inuence the household demand for LPG. Also, although demand is inelastic, we found that LPG consumption by households is more sensitive to changes in prices than income, both in the short and in the long run.",NA,NA,Rodrigues_2050_household,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The sample countries have moved faster than other neighboring countries towards the creation of a single electricity market over the past 30 years. Energy prices are also included in the study due to their important role in affecting the above variables, thus avoiding the problem of omitted variable bias. Tests for panel unit roots, cointegration in heterogeneous panels and panel causality are employed in a trivariate VECM estimated by system GMM. The results show evidence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between the three series and a negative short-run and strong causality from electricity consumption to GDP. As expected, there is bidirectional causality between energy prices and GDP and weaker evidence between electricity consumption and energy prices.

Understanding the domestic demand of oil producing countries is important due to the existence of subsidised supply, loss of foreign exchange income and the environmental effects of oil use. The paper analyses the evolution of petroleum product demand in MENA and presents an econometric analysis of demand using a simple log-linear specification for four petroleum products, namely gasoline, diesel, kerosene and fuel oil. The study covers seven MENA countries, namely Algeria, Iran, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. The results show that demand has grown quite fast in these countries probably because the fuel price has been kept very low while income has risen fast and thus demand has grown fast. The gasoline demand model has performed better than other models in terms of producing expected signs for the parameters. The results for the kerosene model was the least satisfactory as most of the coefficients were found to be statistically insignificant.

The result suggests that no long-run relationship exist between the energy sources and the per capita real income and domestic price. The short-run dynamics using the VAR analysis suggest that the average income elasticity of gas consumption is positive and higher than petroleum and electricity consumptions, making gas consumption more of a luxury than necessity. The domestic price elasticity remains insignificant for the three energy sources. Furthermore, the result of the variance decomposition suggests that whenever there are shocks to electricity and petroleum consumptions, such shocks come mainly from disturbances in the production or supply of the products and not from domestic price and real income shocks.

6647,6IYSJ583,"Fan, Ying; Liao, Hua; Wei, Yi-Ming",Can market oriented economic reforms contribute to energy efficiency improvement? Evidence from China,2007,Energy Policy,4,35,journalArticle,"Since China accelerated its market oriented economic reforms at the end of 1992, its energy intensity has declined 3.6% annually over 1993–2005. However, its energy intensity declined 4.2% annually during its first reform period 1979–1992. Therefore, can we conclude that the accelerated marketization since the end of 1992 has made no contribution to its energy efficiency improvement? In order to answer this challenging question, we examine the changes of energy own-price elasticity, as well as the elasticities of substitution between energy and non-energy (capital and labor) in China during the periods of 1979–1992 and 1993–2003. Generally, in transition or developing economies, holding the technology and output level fixed, if the energy own-price elasticity (algebraic value) declines or the substitution elasticity between factors rises, they will contribute to energy efficiency improvement. Our empirical study finds that: (1) during 1979–1992, the energy own-price elasticity is positive (0.285), and capital-energy, labor-energy are both Morishima complementary; which indicates a distorted energy price and inefficient allocation; and (2) during 1993–2003, the own-price elasticity for energy is negative (−1.236), and capital-energy and labor-energy are both Morishima substitute. All factor demands become more elastic, and all elasticities of substitution increase. The implication is that the accelerated marketization contributes substantially to energy efficiency improvement since 1993.",10.1016/j.enpol.2006.07.011,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421506003077,Fan_2007_can,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The advent of off-grid solar power means that many of these households, at the frontier of global electrification, have a choice between competing sources of electricity. This paper studies the demand for electricity with a discrete choice model wherein households choose between grid electricity, several off-grid electricity sources, and having no electricity at all. The model is estimated using a randomized experiment that varied the price of solar microgrids for a sample of villages in the state of Bihar, India, an outpost on the global electrification frontier. There are three main findings. First, households value electricity, but demand for any one electricity source is highly elastic, because several sources provide similar energy services at similar prices. Second, even in a relatively poor, rural sample, richer households greatly prefer grid electricity. Third, future growth in income will drive an increase in electrification due mainly to new grid connections, even if the cost of solar continues to fall. Our analysis suggests that off-grid solar power provides an important stop-gap technology, which fills the space between having no electricity at all and grid electricity, but that the future will run on the grid.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1825206&site=ehost-live,Burgess_2020_demand,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis of different variables that influence demand concluded with that temperature is the most important explanatory variable when developing a model for estimating the short-term price elasticity. Model results show that no price elasticity is existent on the coldest days, and therewith days with highest peak demand for electricity.

However, the estimated results show some inconsistencies, especially at the sectoral level, across countries. Based on our conjecture that those inconsistencies are mainly due to the effect of contingent energy intensities and partially to different units of analysis, we narrowed the analysis to the industry level and classified 16 industries into energy-intensive and less energy-intensive groups. The effects of price and output on energy demand were then compared between these two groups using 274 industry panel data across 20 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries from 1978 to 2013. The results showed that the price elasticity of energy demand was consistently lower in the energy-intensive group than in the less energy-intensive group, whereas the output elasticity of energy demand was higher in the energy-intensive group than in the less energy-intensive group. Using panel differences and system generalized method of moments estimations, the dynamic elasticities of energy demand were also estimated.

Fuel Choice for industry is modeled as a conditional logit problem where the consumption of each fuel is given relative to the consumption of a base fuel as a function of industry output, relative fuel prices, and other relevant variables. The Energy and Factor Choice model treats the industrial energy demand as a derived factor demand where the factor inputs (including capital, labor, and other materials) are chosen to minimize the total cost of production given as a translogarithmic cost function.

Micro-level data from the Swiss Household Energy Demand Survey are used to estimate the models. Our regression analysis shows that heating consumption decreases with time for all households, but it does not detect any clear short-run impact of the CO2 levy on fossil fuel users in comparison to non-fossil fuel users. We nevertheless find that many factors significantly affect heating consumption, such as setting the thermostat at a lower temperature. Even though further research is needed regarding possible long-run impacts, our findings challenge the relevance of this policy instrument under its current form to lower households’ CO2 emissions.

Regional effects are important—clear differences prevail between East and West Germany.",NA,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421510002752,Braun_2010_determinants,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
1418,YBBSVNPN,"Auffhammer, Maximilian",Climate Adaptive Response Estimation: Short And Long Run Impacts Of Climate Change On Residential Electricity and Natural Gas Consumption Using Big Data,2018,NA,NA,NA,journalArticle,"This paper proposes a simple two-step estimation method (Climate Adaptive Response Estimation--CARE) to estimate sectoral climate damage functions, which account for long-run adaptation. The paper applies this method in the context of residential electricity and natural gas demand for the world's sixth largest economy--California. The advantage of the proposed method is that it only requires detailed information on intensive margin behavior, yet does not require explicit knowledge of the extensive margin response (e.g., technology adoption). Using almost two billion energy bills, we estimate spatially highly disaggregated intensive margin temperature response functions using daily variation in weather. In a second step, we explain variation in the slopes of the dose response functions across space as a function of summer climate. Using 18 state-of-the-art climate models, we simulate future demand by letting households vary consumption along the intensive and extensive margins. We show that failing to account for extensive margin adjustment in electricity demand leads to a significant underestimate of the future impacts on electricity consumption. We further show that reductions in natural gas demand more than offset any climate-driven increases in electricity consumption in this context.",NA,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=1710927&site=ehost-live,Auffhammer_2018_climate,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research focused on the estimating the impact of higher temperatures on electricity consumption using hourly data and annual data. The Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Independent System Operating (ISO) or mid-Atlantic council region of the North American Electric Reliability council was primary area for the study. Additional data was used from the East Central Area Reliability (ECAR) and Southeastern Electric Reliability council (SERC). Scenarios were constructed to present the impact of a 2 degree Fahrenheit increase in temperatures. Short-run and long-run models were used in generating the scenarios. The short-run models were constructed to estimate the sensitivity of the daily load curve to hourly temperature for all ten load regions in the PJM separately. The responses are conditional on a given stock of electricity using equipment, building shell efficiencies, stock of electricity generation facilities, and transmission network. Simulations were run to examine the effect of the temperature increase. These short-run models are especially useful for their detail and relating peak loads and changes in the load curve or human response in terms of electricity demand. The long-run model results are based on a “general equilibrium approach” for the entire U.S. The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) which the Energy Information Administration (EIA) uses in making projections to 2025-2030 was the primary model. In the NEMS, households and firms can adjust stock of electricity using equipment and building shell efficiencies in response to relative prices, economic activity, and technology choices. Similarly, the electric utility sector adjust the mix and stock of generating facilities and transmission network in response to expected demand, relative prices of input sources, technology, and regulatory environment. The output from the short-run and long-run consumption models in terms of load projections and elasticities serve as the inputs to supply side models which allocate or dispatch the electricity from the generation stock and mix to meet the load. Given the dispatch assumptions, that model will project with electricity sector emissions, with a focus on NOx. Climate change will alter the level and timing of electricity demands, as well as the thermal efficiency of electricity generating units. With a given capital stock of generating plant (short run analysis), this will change their operations and emissions. Even in the presence of seasonal or annual emissions caps, emissions might then increase during the warmest days when ozone episodes are most likely to occur. In the long run, the mix and amounts of various types of generation technologies will adjust, and if climate change occurs, the resulting generation plant will be different than if climate change does not occur.",NA,https://www.ce.jhu.edu/epastar2000/epawebsrc/joutz/Final%20Report%20EPA%20Weather%20Effects%20on%20Electricity%20Loads.pdf,Crowley_2005_weather,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
