Due to the endogeneity problem among the variables of interest, as indicated by the findings from the Granger Causality test, weak exogeneity test, and Directed Acyclic Graphs, the use of the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method was deemed appropriate. The SUR model demonstrated that there was low level of substitutability among fossil fuels, but the small magnitude of the estimated coefficient indicates that natural gas, oil, and coal are more properly classified as independent goods than as substitutes of each other within the US market. Income elasticities for all three fossil fuels indicate that they are normal goods. Several external shocks have significant impact on demand for each of the fossil fuels. Slightly lower explanatory power of oil demand equation may be explained with the fact that the model did not include US oil imports although the US economy has been dependent, to some degree, on imported oil.",2016-03,1/25/2023 12:34,1/29/2023 10:32,,284-291,,,55.0,,Energy Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Hydrocarbon Resources Q35; Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply; Prices Q31; Empirical Studies of Trade F14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,1,1

Coal and oil fuels substitute for each other equally. The long-term elasticities of China's coal consumption relative to its hydroelectricity consumption were greater than one and nearly equal during the two sample periods. Therefore, increased hydroelectricity consumption did not imply a reduction in coal consumption. China holds abundant hydroelectricity, wind and, solar energy potential. China must prevent an excessive escalation of its economy and resultant energy demand to realise a meaningful substitution of coal with hydroelectricity.

First, the own price elasticity of natural gas demand increased sharply in the mid 1980's and has declined steadily since. This finding is consistent with increasing reliance on natural gas by residential consumers and improvements in energy efficiency. Second, the income elasticity of U.S. residential natural gas demand has remained relatively constant and consistently negative.

This paper investigates the demand system for the three main energy goods; premium fuel, electricity, and Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) in Tabalong Regency of the South Kalimantan Province. Although the same method was previously used on the different topics, this paper uniquely utilizes the combined Linear Approximation and Quadratic Almost-Ideal Demand System on the particular energy policy topic. This paper utilizes the National Social Economics Survey conducted by BPS-Statistics of Tabalong Regency in 2016. The results show that the income elasticity of demand for the top 60% and the bottom 40% of the income groups were positive; however, slight differences could be seen. For the top 60% of the income group, the income elasticities of demand were 0.97, 1.02, and 1.08 for premium fuel, electricity, and LPG respectively. On the other hand, the bottom 40% of the income group had 0.99, 1.07, and 0.91 of income elasticity of demand for premium, electricity, and LPG. The price elasticity of demand for both income groups had negative signs, which is agreeing with the theoretical demand function.

The analysis obtains a decomposition of efficiency into persistent (PE) and time-varying (TVE) components. Total inefficiency is relatively small in most sectors and price elasticities are relatively high. If all plants performed at the 90th percentile of their efficiency distribution, the reduction in energy is between 4% and 37%.

Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and Chow test. Results show that the energy sources used in the rural areas are fuelwood (51.5%) and kerosene (48.5), while those used in the urban areas are fuelwood (30.6%), charcoal (31.6%), kerosene (33.7%) and liquefied petroleum gas (4.1%).

To estimate the impact of the VAT change on demand, we perform an event study on the electricity flowed monthly over the grid at the network operator level. Our findings reveal that both the tax cut and the tax hike were entirely shifted to the electricity price (i.e., 100%). Exploiting different sources of price variation, our results reveal a price elasticity of residential demand for electricity between -0.09 and -0.17.

The mechanism sets binding energy-saving targets on electricity and gas distributors with at least 50,000 clients and includes a voluntary opt-in model for participation from other parties. This paper investigates and assesses the elements of the scheme that help overcome several barriers to deliver industrial energy efficiency. Results from a survey conducted among leading experts indicate that the Italian system provides a strong financial incentive to energy efficiency investments, covering a significant share of investment costs and thus reducing payback time. Moreover, the scheme fosters the development of energy service companies (ESCOs), which are key to developing, installing and arranging finance for projects on the ground. In conjunction with other policies, the mechanism also raises awareness of energy efficiency investment opportunities, thus helping overcome the market failure of insufficient information.

The analysis reveals the competitiveness of Russian LNG exports along the Northeast Passage due to Yamal LNG, which could be a game-changer for global LNG supplies. We further find that an ice-free NEP is primarily relevant for maritime bulk, and particularly LNG, shipping, and thus of great geopolitical importance and strategic interest, especially for Russia and the US on the supply side, and China, Japan, and South Korea on the demand side.

LCOHs were then compiled into a supply curve from which several conclusions could be drawn. Our evaluation revealed that EGS district heating has the potential to supply cost-effective energy for space and water heating in several New York and Pennsylvania communities in the near future. To realize wider deployment, modest improvements in EGS technology, escalation of natural gas prices, and/or government incentives will likely be required to enable GDH to compete with other heating alternatives today.

While both oil price crises in 1973 and 1979/1980 were ultimately caused by supply actions of members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), all three oil price crises were preceded by high demand growth. Other aspects that favoured a high oil price in all three cases were low investments in new oil fields, as a consequence low spare capacity, and a weak US dollar. In addition, the recent oil price surge has been characterised by a high global refinery utilisation and refineries that did not adapt fast enough to the rising demand for lighter oil products. Moreover, broader geopolitical uncertainties, combined with risks associated with the oil trade helped push the oil price into a triple-digit zone.

The main purpose of this paper is to examine causality and relationship among EG, EC, and CS, to forecast these variables and to propose related policy viewpoints for Iran. The empirical findings indicate the lack of short-run causality between pairwise variables. The results of standard Granger-causality (SGC) test demonstrate a bi-directional long-run causality between EC and EG and a uni-directional long-run causality from EC to CS. To forecast variables, the vector auto regression (VAR) model is estimated using logged variables. The Arino and Franses approach is applied to transform time series data and forecast variables. The performance of the estimated VAR model is investigated and it clarified a highly accurate estimation with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of less than 4% for all variables. The results of the impulse response function (IRF) analysis indicate the dynamic behavior of long-run causalities. Therefore, to reduce EC and avoid negative impact on EG, Iran should adopt appropriate and affordable policies to raise efficiency optimization of EC.

Research Methods: Based on the coal, oil, gas, electricity consumption and GDP annual data, the Markov regime switching causal model (MSC) is used to carry out empirical research. Research Findings: Economic growth can increase the consumption of coal, oil, natural gas and electricity, and other heterogeneous energy sources. Among them, the growth of oil and gas consumption will promote economic growth. Economic growth has a longer duration on coal and oil energy consumption, the duration of economic growth on gas and electricity energy consumption is shorter, and the duration of four energy consumption on economic growth is roughly the same. In recent years, only the oil energy consumption can show the non-linear dynamic driving effect on economic growth. Economic growth can play a nonlinear and dynamic role in oil and coal consumption. In the financial crisis, it is difficult to show the effect of economic growth on the unidirectional time-varying causality of energy consumption, in which coal, oil, and gas cannot show the unidirectional time-varying causal effect on economic growth, while the electricity consumption has a unidirectional time-varying causal relationship to economic growth. Research Innovations: Based on the MSC model, the time-varying causality relationship between the heterogeneous energy consumption and economic growth in different periods is determined by measuring the switching probability, and then the nonlinear dynamic driving mechanism is revealed.

The paper offers a clear process for identifying an appropriate model to assess the impact of changes in temperature on each of the seven sectors using natural gas. The study considers the use of natural gas in each sector as a dependent variable and average temperature as the independent variable. The values of temperature and use of natural gas in each sector for each of the country's 25 provinces are collected on a monthly basis. Provinces are considered as cross sections in the model, while months provide time series data that are combined together in regression analysis to understand the relationship among these two variables for each of sub sector of natural gas demand.

The seasonal nature of demand for natural gas seasonality has created many problems for honoring export commitments, injection of gas into oil fields and meeting peak demand of domestic users. To respond to high demand for natural gas in the cold season the country has to store excess natural gas during the warm season for use in winter. Optimal storage capacity, in turn is dependent on a solid projection of future peak seasonal demand. This paper is prepared with the objective of projecting future peak demand and associated need for storage facilities. In this paper we use Neural Network and Seasonal ARIMA methods to forecast seasonal natural gas consumption over Iran's 5th development plan period and calculate the requited storage capacity. The results show that neural network methodology has superior predictive power compared to the ARIMA method. The seasonal nature of demand for natural gas is expected to continue.

Our results indicate that around 70 percent of expenditures under the Canadian subsidy and tax credit programs represented free riding. We estimate that the cost effectiveness of the programs in terms of greenhouse gas reduced was at least $100/t CO2, and potentially as high as $800/t CO2, depending on the assumptions made. Further, we find that a substantial majority of the grants were received by middle- and high-income households, such that the grant had a regressive effect on the distribution of income. We conclude that such grants are not an optimal way to improve residential energy efficiency.",2014,1/25/2023 12:50,1/25/2023 12:50,,50 pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: University of Ottawa, Department of Economics, Working Papers: E1404E",,,,"Energy: General Q40; Environmental Economics: General Q50; Taxation, Subsidies, and Revenue: General H20",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,37

Then I estimate indicators related to CO2 emissions, energy use, and economic activity. In the light of empirical results, I identify policy instruments and structural issues. Finally, I present a comparative analysis of Chile and other Latin American countries. Statistical tests show that variability of CO2 emissions is explained mostly by GDP per capita ('affluence') than any other tested variable. Indicators show that the diversification and decarbonisation of the energy mix has been a major policy challenge. With two notable exceptions (hydro and natural gas), the CO2 intensity of the energy supply mix suggests no effective policies, while energy security crises triggered negative carbon effects and increased prices. No clear policies to promote energy efficiency can be identified until 2005. Explicit policy instruments to promote renewable energy are only recognised after 2004.

This policy so far has led to only small reductions in energy use within the home, and even these reductions are only partly attributable to conservation behavior. Among the many obstacles to residential conservation that have come to light, a major one is the difficulty of predicting what savings will result from any specific investment in home energy efficiency. Ten years of experience after the 1973 oil crisis raises doubts about the feasibility of residential conservation as a short-term energy strategy, and suggests that new policies are needed to improve the operation of the market for conservation investment.",1983,2/26/2023 10:24,2/26/2023 10:41,2023-02-16 15:36:26,432-448,,3,2.0,,,The market needs help,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,46

This technique allows us to incorporate the characteristic features of electricity prices (such as seasonal volatility, time varying mean reversion and seasonally occurring price spikes) into the model in an elegant and economically justifiable way. The stochastic time change introduces stochastic as well as deterministic (e.g., seasonal) features in the price process' volatility and in the jump component. We specify the base process as a mean reverting jump diffusion and the time change as an absolutely continuous stochastic process with seasonal component. The activity rate of the stochastic time change can be related to the factors that influence supply and demand. Here we use the temperature as a proxy for the demand and hence, as the driving factor of the stochastic time change, and show that this choice leads to realistic price paths. We derive properties of the resulting price process and develop the model calibration procedure. We calibrate the model to the historical EEX power prices and apply it to generating realistic price paths by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that the simulated price process matches the distributional characteristics of the observed electricity prices in periods of both high and low demand.",2017-03,1/25/2023 12:35,1/25/2023 12:35,,51-65,,,63.0,,Energy Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,48

Firstly, based on the energy hub model, a generic method for modelling the steady-state energy balance equation of MES is proposed. Then, considering the multi-energy substitution effect in the background of multi-energy coupling, the concept of price-based integrated demand response (P-IDR) is introduced. Meanwhile, based on the price elasticity theory and the discrete choice theory, the energy timing transfer characteristics and energy substitution characteristics in P-IDR is modelled. Furthermore, after taking into account the P-IDR, an MINLP model for day-ahead dispatch of MES is built, and a generalized benders decomposition method is used for solution. Case studies are conducted on an MES to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modelling method.

In Asia, growth in demand and availability of coal is resulting in its accelerated use. However, despite investment, production cannot keep up with demand, and coal trade in Asia is increasingly affecting international markets. In Europe, the environmental impacts of coal use, particularly CO2 but also particulates, are accelerating the closure of many power stations and delaying new build. Consequently, in most countries its contribution is set to decrease. However, some countries are planning new, large coal stations and are increasing operation prior to closure of some existing stations. The continued use of fossil fuels, especially coal, is resulting in emission levels that in the short term will exceed the internationally agreed climate protection objectives.

The African continent remains the region that is most vulnerable to this threat. This study examines the link between electricity use and health in Africa using the panel vector autoregressiveâ€“vector error correction Granger-causality approach. The findings reveal that shortâ€“ and long-run causalities exist between electricity consumption and health across the panels of seven African countries (Angola, Algeria, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, and Republic of Congo), but the rate of adjustment to the long-run position is slower.

Space heating is highly dependent on ambient conditions and susceptible to climate change. We adopt a techno-economic standpoint and assess the impact of climate change on decentralised heating demand and the cost-optimal mix of heat pump and gas boiler technologies. Temperature data with high spatial resolution from nine climate models implementing three Representative Concentration Pathways from IPCC are used to estimate climate induced changes in the European demand side for heating. The demand side is modelled by the proxy of heating-degree days. The supply side is modelled by using a screening curve approach to the economics of heat generation. We find that space heating demand decreases by about 16%, 24% and 42% in low, intermediate and extreme global warming scenarios. When considering historic weather data, we find a heterogeneous mix of technologies are cost-optimal, depending on the heating load factor (number of full-load hours per year). Increasing ambient temperatures toward the end-century improve the economic performance of heat pumps in all concentration pathways.

More importantly, and since carbon dioxide emissions are linearly related to the amounts of fuel consumed, our results allow us to estimate the costs of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from different energy sources. We estimate that marginal abatement costs for carbon dioxide are â‚¬45.62 per ton of carbon dioxide per year for coal, â‚¬66.52 for oil, â‚¬91.07 for gas, â‚¬191.13 for electricity and â‚¬254.23 for biomass.

Auditing energy efficiency was recently undertaken in one of the top 1,000 largest Chinese enterprises. The objectives of this paper are to fill a gap in the literature of auditing energy efficiency for a Chinese manufacturing enterprise and to share the audited energy efficiency results. This paper concludes that if the enterprise invests $1.9 million to improve energy efficiency, the investment will be recovered in about 18 months. The net present value of the investment would be about $9.8 million at a discount rate of 12%. The investment will reduce a large amount of energy consumption at the enterprise based on its figures in 2008, including 15% of electricity, 40% of fuel oil, and 54% of diesel.

In this paper, a demand response strategy for distribution grid management is proposed in which the distribution system operator (DSO) uses the flexibility of energy hubs in a demand response format to improve the operation. Moreover, it also provides benefits for energy hubs. The proposed strategy uses a recursive two-level optimization structure to model the interactions between DSO and energy hubs. As well as electrical loads of energy hubs, thermal loads are considered flexible with thermal constraints. Therefore, the flexibility of energy hubs is increased. Stochastic optimization is integrated into the proposed method to handle the uncertainty of intermittent energies such as wind energy. The strategy is implemented in a 6-bus and 18-bus test systems. The simulation results evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy. The results show that peak loads of energy hub and distribution grid are reduced by 29% and 14% in the 6-bus test system, respectively.

This article details the development of a model-based assessment on water consumption and withdrawal pertaining to the use-phase of conventional and alternative transportation modes based on regional energy and fuel production. An extensive literature review details water consumption from fuel extraction, processing, and distribution as well as power plant operations. Using Model-Based Systems Engineering principles and the Systems Modeling Language, a multi-level, multi-modal framework was developed and applied to the Metro Atlanta transportation system consisting of conventional and alternative vehicles across varying conditions. According to the analysis, vehicles powered by locally produced biofuels and electricity (assuming average local grid mix for charging) consume more water than locally refined gasoline and CNG-powered vehicles. Improvements in power plant technologies, electricity generation (e.g., use of solar and wind versus hydro power), and vehicle efficiencies can reduce such water consumption significantly.

A decline in coal prices caused by overcapacity not only determines the survival of coal enterprises but also directly affects economic growth, energy security and industrial raw material supply. This study uses the difference-in-differences model to quantitatively evaluate the treatment effect of coal de-capacity policies on coal prices. Empirical results are summarised as follows. Firstly, the de-capacity policy positively influenced coal prices. The de-capacity policies in 2013 and 2016 increased coal price by 3.24% and 3.44%, respectively. Secondly, significant differences in the timeliness of the two de-capacity policies were observed. The effects of the 2013 and 2016 policies were observed in the first and seventh month after promulgation and lasted for 3 and 13 months, respectively. The main reason for this difference is that the latter policy clearly defined the task of de-capacity and its deadline. Thirdly, different de-capacity policy measures had various effects on coal prices. Strengthening the management of coal import and export decelerated the downward trend of coal prices, and restrictions on 276 working days per year boost coal prices. A market-oriented, early warning mechanism for overcapacity should be established considering the importance of policies to the stability of coal price.

By taking account of breaks identified in the series, we find that, while the EUA and CER returns present comparable dynamics mainly driven by fuel switching, the long-term relationships between the price of these two types of permits and their drivers differ significantly. Whereas the price of EUA is well explained by a demand effect, the impact of energy prices on the CER price suggests the existence of a supply-side effect for credits.

A casual look at the geographic incidence of opioid mortality shows sharply higher mortality rates in the Appalachian region, especially in coal-mining areas. This has led observers to make a link that was characterized by one newspaper as ""abandoned by coal, swallowed by opioids."" We test that theory using restricted death data and mine level coal production data. Specifically, we examine whether higher reliance on coal mining in a county's economy leads to higher or lower opioid mortality. We find a positive relationship between the share of coal miners among total local labor force and county-level opioid mortality rates. This contradicts the ""abandoned by coal, swallowed by opioids"" story. Rather our results suggest that the higher rates of injury in underground coal mining (in particular) lead to greater amounts of opioid consumption and mortality. An implication is that the decline in coal mining in the United States may have a positive spillover in the form of reduced mortality from opioid use.",2019,1/25/2023 12:38,1/25/2023 12:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc, NBER Working Papers: 26551",,,,Hydrocarbon Resources Q35; Exhaustible Resources and Economic Development Q32; Health: General I10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,73

Coal to gas switching has been triggered by the recent shale gas revolution, which the entire U.S. has experienced, not the RGGI region alone. If RGGI as a cap-and-trade carbon program did not work effectively, the rate of fuel switching would have been similar to that of other U.S. states. To estimate the effects of RGGI implementation in terms of the fuel switching, we use the synthetic control method for comparative case studies. Results provide a strong evidence that coal to gas switching has been actually accelerated by RGGI implementation.

Most likely, shale gas also comes with a smaller GHG footprint than coal. However, shale gas extraction can affect water safety. This paper also discusses related aspects that exemplify how shale gas can be more beneficial in the short and long term.

The model is fitted to years 2000-2011 recorded data for South Africa to make a comparative analysis with the generalized Pareto-type (GP-type) distribution. Peak electricity demand is influenced by the tails of probability distributions as well as by means or averages. At times there is a need to depart from the average thinking and exploit information provided by the extremes (tails). Empirical results show that both the GP-type and the GPD are a good fit to the data. One of the main advantages of the GP-type is the estimation of only one parameter. Modelling of extreme daily increases in peak electricity demand helps in quantifying the amount of electricity which can be shifted from the grid to off peak periods. One of the policy implications derived from this study is the need for day-time use of electricity billing system similar to the one used in the cellular telephone/and fixed line-billing technology. This will result in the shifting of electricity demand on the grid to off peak time slots as users try to avoid high peak hour charges.,2013-02,1/25/2023 12:39,1/25/2023 12:39,,90-96,,1,53.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Economic Development: Agriculture; Electric Utilities L94; Energy; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,78

This property is relevant in a number of cases. For instance, the deregulated market for electricity power in the Nordic countries is characterized by electricity spot prices with a high degree of long memory. It occurs that in some time periods bilateral prices are identical whereas in other periods the prices differ. The latter occurs when a capacity congestion exists across regions and multiple price areas will result. If the price series are fractionally integrated this means that in some regimes, an extreme form of fractional cointegration amongst prices will exist. We define a Markov switching fractional integration model from which the fractional orders of integration in separate states can be estimated using Maximum Likelihood techniques. The model is adapted to data for the Nordic electricity spot market, and we find that regime swithing and long memory are empirically relevant to co-exist. In particular, we find that the price behaviour for single markets can be very different depending upon the presence or absence of bottlenecks in electricity transmission. Using Monte Carlo forecasting we find that the regime switching model appears to be especially attractive in forecasting relative prices.",2000,1/25/2023 12:52,1/25/2023 12:52,,30-30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: Department of Economics, University of Aarhus, Department of Economics, Working Papers",,,,Single Equation Models; Diffusion Processes; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect Models; Multiple or Simultaneous Equation Models: Time-Series Models; State Space Models C32; Diffusion Processes C22; Single Variables: Time-Series Models; Single Variables: General C20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,81

In many developed countries, carbon taxes are regressive as they comprise a greater proportion of a poorer household's income. Certain socioeconomic groups are more negatively affected by these impacts than others. While inequality of incidence by income group has received great attention in the literature, a gap exists to quantify the inequality associated with socioeconomic characteristics. This information is policy-relevant as it may inform the most effective means to offset negative welfare impacts through changes to taxes and/or social transfers. This paper provides this contribution. First, the inequality of carbon tax incidence across the income spectrum is quantified using the concentration index methodology. A subsequent multivariate decomposition quantifies the contribution each socioeconomic factor makes towards this inequality of incidence. This is carried out for electricity, motor fuel and all other home fuels to elicit variation of socioeconomic incidence by source. While income contributes a great deal towards inequality of incidence for other home fuels, other socioeconomic characteristics are the primary determinants of electricity and motor fuel-related carbon tax incidence. The relative importance of each characteristic in determining regressive impacts is quantified and this varies by carbon tax source.",2017-12,1/25/2023 12:36,1/25/2023 12:36,,31-45,,,142.0,,Ecological Economics,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Electric Utilities L94; Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels L71; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Environmental Economics: Government Policy Q58; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies H23; Redistributive Effects; Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Equity, Justice, Inequality, and Other Normative Criteria and Measurement D63; Taxation and Subsidies: Incidence H22",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,82

The bias caused by sectoral aggregation is estimated by calibrating a computable general equilibrium model to this dataset and comparing results with those generated from more aggregated data. A stylized unilateral carbon pricing policy is simulated. Results show that aggregated calibrations overestimate industrial output loss and underestimate the increase in the CO2 embodied in imports.

A novel feature of our study is that we deploy large numbers of data loggers which allow us to measure temperature and humidity at high frequency inside homes. We find that the upgrades had no detectable impact on electricity use or thermal comfort, with essentially identical temperature and humidity levels in upgraded and non-upgraded homes. These results stand in sharp contrast to the engineering estimates that predicted considerable improvements in thermal comfort and up to a 26% decrease in electricity use. As we document, part of the explanation is that most households have their windows open on hot days, nullifying the thermal benefits of roof and wall insulation. Overall, we conclude that the benefits from these investments are unlikely to exceed the costs, which added $650-$850 USD to the cost of each home.

However, at present, cement is still an unsustainable basic building material, and as such cannot be reused. During the production process, cement consumes a great deal of coal, electricity, and other energy resources. In this way, cement belongs to the category of traditional industries with a high-energy consumption and environmental impact, including the emission of serious levels of air pollutants such as dust. With increasingly serious problems relating to resources and the environment in China, the problem of energy saving and emission reduction in the cement industry is becoming more and more important. We use the translog cost function to investigate inter-factor and inter-fuel substitution in China's cement industry over the period from 1994 to 2014. The results revealed that capital is in an absolute core position, so energy or the labor force has no obvious substitution effect on capital, which leads to more and more reliance on the capital input of the cement industry. In addition, the substitution elasticity of coal and oil in the cement industry is very high. Therefore, in the process of cement production, it is possible to promote the use of natural gas.",2019-04,1/25/2023 12:31,1/29/2023 10:30,,967-979,,5,55.0,,Emerging Markets Finance and Trade,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Economic Development: Agriculture; Energy; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Environment P28; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Natural Resources; Cement; Ceramics L61; Choice of Technology O14; Glass; Industrialization; Manufacturing and Service Industries; Metals and Metal Products; Industry Studies; Population P23; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Factor and Product Markets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,90

Fundamental to the economic challenge was high and rising energy prices, already heavily subsidized for consumers. With the government intent on staving off emerging political unrest through a series of measures, buffering consumers from increased energy prices being a key action, fiscal costs mounted. By 2012, subsidies on petroleum products alone were about 2.8 percent of GDP and 8.8 percent of government expenditures. At the same time, political unrest disrupted the supply of natural gas from Egypt and Jordan abruptly had to switch to using imported oil products (heavy fuel oil and diesel) to produce electricity. Consequently, the cost of producing electricity increased several folds. As the increased cost was not passed on to the consumers, National Electric Power company (NEPCO), bore all the increases in fuel prices and accumulate debt as a result. At approximately 17 percent of government expenditures and 5.5 percent of GDP in 2011, this was twice the amount of the petroleum subsidies. The chapter is organized as follows. Section two traces the evolution of subsidies in Jordan in recent times. The distributional impacts of reform would depend on how important the subsidized items are to consumers in terms of their expenditures on those items. Section three discusses this question from the perspective of richer and poorer households. The distributional impacts of reform would of course not only depend on how much consumers spend on the subsidized items but also on the extent of price changes. Sections four and five simulate direct and indirect impacts of potential reform scenarios across the income distribution. From this discussion, in section six the chapter moves onto considering how reforms are weighed down by vexing political economy constraints. In MENA countries, universal subsidies have been in place as part of the governmentâ€™s role in ensuring stability in the lives of the people and doing away with them is not straightforward.",2015,1/26/2023 1:34,2/28/2023 1:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,92

As the energy that is shared among the community is commonly electricity, the energy community's literature is dominated by electricity-systems and mostly neglects collective thermal energy as an alternative energy carrier for heating and cooling. Our goal in this article is to organise the existing research on ""community-based initiatives for heating and cooling "" by using the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, and based on this analysis, identify a future research agenda. Our analysis reveals that the number of publications in this area has been growing fast recently, focusing on technological challenges. Fewer papers take an institutional point of view, in which they cover policies, price reforms and values. The institutionally oriented papers focus on solar thermal energy and bio-based thermal energy. Other thermal technologies, such as geothermal wells, are largely neglected in the literature, but are known to have different institutional constraints. Informal rules and values are mainly researched from a consumer perspective. Since energy communities often consist of consumers and prosumers, additional research is warranted into this area. Evaluative criteria for such communities are limited to economic aspects and greenhouse gas emissions, while indicators such as soil pollution and spatial planning that may play an equally important role are neglected. We recommend studying thermal energy communities as distinctive entities with their own unique characteristics, and we develop a research agenda for this purpose.",2022-06,1/25/2023 12:31,1/25/2023 12:31,,,,,88.0,,Energy Research and Social Science,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Electric Utilities L94; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Air Pollution; Hazardous Waste; Noise; Recycling Q53; Solid Waste; Water Pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,94

Since almost all electricity use takes place in conjunction with durable appliance use, a short-run experiment is unlikely to induce a significant change in household durable holdings. Thus, at best the experiments are valuable in estimation of the Marshallian short-run response where the capital stock is held fixed. In this paper we investigate the effects of a permanent TOD rate schedule. At the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation, optimal TOD rates have been offered since January 1976.

In this study, a decarbonization model with consideration of both technological progress and cross-regional power transmission for China's power sector is built to explore the potential and possible pathway of decarbonization under the constraint of optimal cost. The model is operated at different carbon prices in three economic growth scenarios. Our findings show that the power generation structure is undergoing a shift from coal power to hydropower, nuclear power, and wind power, and both the coal power generation and carbon emissions can peak by 2030. Carbon pricing can speed up this process and reduce the peak height. Additionally, an appropriate carbon price has a significant promoting effect on decarbonization in the power sector; we conclude that the optimal carbon price is 21 USD/t. Moreover, the higher the economic development level, the lower the final average cost of power generation mix and the more significant the carbon emissions reduction, which implies that it is more cost-effective to carry out decarbonization related policy in the power sector during the stage of rapid economic growth.",2021-03,1/25/2023 12:35,1/25/2023 12:35,,,,,150.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Economic Development: Agriculture; Energy; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Environmental Economics: Technological Innovation Q55; Environment P28; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Natural Resources; Environment and Development; Environment and Trade; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth Q56; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,99

We find that interaction of regulatory uncertainty with irreversible investment always raises the social cost of carbon abatement. Further, the social cost of regulatory uncertainty is strongly dependent on the relative competitiveness of IGCC plants, for which the cost of later carbon capture retrofits is comparatively small, and on the firms ability to use investments in natural gas generation as a transitional strategy to manage carbon regulation uncertainty. Without highly competitive IGCC or low gas prices, regulatory uncertainty can increase the expected social cost of reducing emissions by 40 to 60%.",2007,1/25/2023 12:34,1/25/2023 12:34,,101-127,,4,28.0,,Energy Journal,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy L98; Environmental Economics: Government Policy Q58; Diffusion Processes O33; Technological Change: Choices and Consequences; Economics of Regulation L51; Capacity G31; Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,101

We find that large scale spending and cost recovery for network upgrades is likely to result in net negative impacts on key macroeconomic indicators, including real income available for spending across all UK households. This is due to a combination of time-limited network upgrade activity in the presence of capacity constraints combined with the need for costs to be passed on to electricity consumers through higher bills. But the lowest income households--the group of greatest concern to policymakers--suffer the smallest losses. Moreover, the EV uptake delivers sufficient gains that deliver net positive impacts on all household incomes, with sustained expansion in GDP and employment across the economy.

These offsets depend on the direct displacement of high-cost natural gas generators, and on the hydropower reallocation that occurs to the hours with the lowest increase in renewable generation. Solar power daily intermittency shifts hydro from the afternoon to the evening, which increases its emissions offsets since the gas generators displaced in the evening are dirtier than those kept running in the afternoon. In contrast, wind offsets are less sensitive to hydropower reallocation, since it leads to a substitution of generators with similar emissions intensities. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between wind, solar, and hydro capacity in assessing their environmental benefits. Similar lessons will apply to electric grids with storage capacity.",2019-01,1/25/2023 12:33,1/25/2023 12:33,,213-246,,1,40.0,,Energy Journal,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Electric Utilities L94; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Dynamic Analysis C61; Optimization Techniques; Programming Models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,107

In view of this high share, we study the CO_{2} emissions of ASEAN's electricity production sector with a focus on the aggregate emission intensity (ACI) given by the level of CO_{2} emissions for each unit of electricity produced. Drivers of ACI are analysed for individual countries and spatial analysis is conducted by comparing factors contributing to differences between the ACIs of individual countries and that of the ASEAN average. Arising from these analyses and in light of the current developments, it is concluded that drastic actions need to be taken both at the national and regional levels in order to reduce growth in the region's electricity-related CO_{2} emissions.

I apply the logic of compound distribution which is widely used in the actuarial models. Actuarial models combine the distribution of frequency of losses with their severity distribution to produce an objective distribution of losses due to operational risk. Such models combine two distributions: loss frequencies and loss severities. The loss frequency distribution describes the number of loss events over a fixed interval of time. The loss severity distribution describes the size of the loss once it occurs. In my case, loss frequencies are frequencies of accidents, which follow the Poisson distribution, and loss severities are the number of deaths in each accident, which follow the Logarithmic series distribution. Then the compound distribution is the negative binomial distribution, which will fit the number of deaths over a fixed interval of time. The second thesis presents an empirical analysis of labor productivity in China's coal mining. The overall motivation for this work is the explanation of observed changes in labor productivity from 1980 through 2004. I begin with data on annual output and labor productivity for state-owned key mining companies in China, and use panel regression methods to study the productivity. I employ the productivity indices defined by Stoker (2005)--fixed effect index, scale effect index and time effect index--which are in line with the panel data concepts. In the period 1980-1993, I find that those three indices capture virtually all the changes in observed labor productivity. But in the period 1994-2004, scale effects and time effects capture the variation. Fixed effects did not play an important role in this period, which reflected some stationarity in technology or the lack in capital investments. In both periods the price effects, a main component of the time effects, accounted for a substantial portion of the change of labor productivity, which was in line with the process of price and wage reform that began in 1979. In the third thesis, I apply semi-parametric smooth coefficient, model (SSCM) to analyze the determinants of economic growth and regional disparities. The analysis applies the combination of SSCM and augmented Solow model, using data from 1991 to 2004 on the provincial level. The SSCM allows geographic factor and time factor to work as determinants of the marginal effects of policy variables (the coefficient of a policy variable is a function of the geographic factor and time factor) instead of explanatory variables as dummies. I find that the marginal effects of the policy variables vary significantly across regions and over years. It suggests that in comparing the traditional constant coefficient models, the SSCM has more capabilities to capture the reality.",2011-12,1/25/2023 12:48,1/25/2023 12:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,Binghamton University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,"Energy; Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels L71; Environment P28; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Natural Resources; Socialist Systems and Transitional Economies: Urban, Rural, and Regional Economics P25; Human Capital; Labor Productivity J24; Occupational Choice; Skills; Model Construction and Estimation C51; Economic Development: General O10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,112

Frequently cited bioenergy goals would at least double the present global human use of plant material, the production of which already requires the dedication of roughly 75% of vegetated lands and more than 70% of water withdrawals. However, burning biomass for energy provision increases the amount of carbon in the air just like burning coal, oil, or gas if harvesting the biomass decreases the amount of carbon stored in plants and soils, or reduces carbon sequestration. Neglecting this fact results in an accounting error that could be corrected by considering that only the use of 'additional biomass'--biomass from additional plant growth or biomass that would decompose rapidly if not used for bioenergy--can reduce carbon emissions. Failure to correct this accounting flaw will likely have substantial adverse consequences.

One approach for confronting deforestation suggested in the literature has been off-farm employment (OFE), since it takes household labor away from the farm, reducing pressures on the land while also increasing farm household incomes--a win-win solution. It has thus come to be promoted by policymakers and economists as a way to address deforestation in environmentally sensitive areas. Nevertheless, research on the impact of OFE on land use and deforestation at the household level continues to be sparse. This dissertation investigates the economic and non-economic factors affecting the OFE and land clearing/use choices of migrant settler households in the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon (NEA) rainforest, an area of extraordinary biodiversity that has been undergoing rapid deforestation since the discovery of oil in 1967. Land clearing/use and household labor allocation are interrelated but have not been examined together in previous empirical studies. In this dissertation, I use detailed data from a probability sample of over 700 farm households to assess the factors that affect the choices of men and women to engage in OFE and the impact of that OFE on land clearing and land use. Following development of the theoretical model of the farm household, bivariate probit analysis with household level fixed effects is used to determine the individual characteristics that affect participation in farm work and OFE. Because participation in OFE is a choice variable, the analysis of the impact of OFE on land clearing/use utilizes an instrumental variables framework with community level fixed effects. I find that households who take part in more OFE do not deforest significantly less than other households, nor do they allocate their land to different uses than households who choose not to participate. Thus policies to promote more OFE, such as the expansion of road networks, increases in educational opportunities, and improved access to electricity, will not solve the problem of deforestation. In the concluding chapter I offer further suggestions for policy as well as on improving data collection and extending the empirical model.",2009-12,1/25/2023 12:51,1/25/2023 12:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of North Carolina,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Economic Development: Agriculture; Energy; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Biodiversity Conservation; Bioeconomics; Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Services; Industrial Ecology Q57; Renewable Resources and Conservation: Forestry Q23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,124

The increasing electricity generation by renewable resources gives rise to various structural issues like uncertainty and variability in modern power systems. Here, facing the abovementioned issues will be one of the most pressing problems in future energy systems and leads to define a new feature namely as power system flexibility. A novel framework for considering the enhancement of flexibility in the power system is presented in this paper. So, an innovative structure is suggested for flexibility improvement based upon unit commitment problem as well as construction of flexible fast ramp generating units. Here, an innovative formulation for uncertainty based flexible unit commitment and construction in combination with demand response resources i.e. (UBFUCCDRRs) is suggested. There are several uncertain resources affecting the UBFUCCDRRs. Here, one of the foremost imperative issues is the uncertainty of demand side resources. This paper considered, the price-elasticity of electrical consumption, as an uncertain, unavailable and hard to estimate parameter which is modelled using Z numbers as a possibilistic-probabilistic methodology. Moreover, the supply side resources uncertainty considered with Monte Carlo simulation methodology. In the modern smart grids, DRRs, fast ramp resources and energy storages can be considered for compensating the variability and uncertainty of renewable energy resources. Actually, with an increasing thrust towards renewable integration across the globe, energy storage as one of the most important flexibility resources has the potential to manage demand and supply dynamics. The energy storage is mostly used to adjust the timing of electricity supply by storing electricity at the lowest price level and discharging at an expensive time. So the energy storage plays an important role in reducing costs and increasing flexibility at the same time. Therefore, this paper sheds light on the various issues of future flexible power systems with significant amounts of non-dispatchable and uncertain renewable energy capacities. UBFUCCDRRs 's primary goal is to determine the optimum flexibility value as a key problem while achieving the operation and investment costs at the lowest possible level. The results indicate improvement of the flexibility index with cost adjustment. In order to trace the capability of the suggested framework, several cases are modeled on a modified standard 10-unit system.",  6/1/2020,2/24/2023 11:49,2/27/2023 2:22,2023-02-15 19:26:42,101290,,,29.0,,Journal of Energy Storage,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Enigmatic demand elasticity; Flexible power system; Flexible resources; UBFUCC; Z numbers method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,125

This paper proposes a dynamic pricing DR algorithm for energy management in a hierarchical electricity market that considers both service providerâ€™s (SP) profit and customersâ€™ (CUs) costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to illustrate the hierarchical decision-making framework, in which the dynamic pricing problem is formulated as a discrete finite Markov decision process (MDP), and Q-learning is adopted to solve this decision-making problem. Using RL, the SP can adaptively decide the retail electricity price during the on-line learning process where the uncertainty of CUsâ€™ load demand profiles and the flexibility of wholesale electricity prices are addressed. Simulation results show that this proposed DR algorithm, can promote SP profitability, reduce energy costs for CUs, balance energy supply and demand in the electricity market, and improve the reliability of electric power systems, which can be regarded as a win-win strategy for both SP and CUs.", 6/15/2018,2/24/2023 7:52,2/24/2023 8:22,2023-02-15 19:04:06,220-230,,,220.0,,Applied Energy,A Dynamic pricing demand response algorithm for smart grid,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,Demand response; Dynamic pricing; Q-learning; Markov decision process; Artificial intelligence; Reinforcement learning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,126

Despite the increased efficiency with respect to labour needs, old and new technologies both require large numbers of workers during the construction period, leading to a situation of potential social and demographic change to nearby communities, which are often located in remote areas and with a low capacity to accommodate waves of rapid population growth. Advances in energy boomtown studies provide a theoretically sophisticated framework for understanding the potential impact of these projects, particularly in terms of drastic population growth and subsequent damage to the social fabric. In this article, I study the social impact of the most prominent energy development of this type in contemporary Spain, the As Pontes fossil fuelled power plant. While data analysis shows mixed evidence of increases in crime, social tensions between different intra-class and inter-class groups extend beyond manufacturing and remain after the production period. More consistent, however, is the evidence of significant increases in social illnesses such as suicides among the young during the closure period.

Adequate pricing of electricity to allow for cost recovery is also important to minimize the power sector's negative macroeconomic, fiscal, environmental, and social impacts. This paper takes stock of the empirical and conceptual literature on the financial viability and cost recovery of the power sector in developing countries. Time-series data across countries are relatively scarce, but comparing the findings from 21 studies suggests that under-recovery of costs remains pervasive despite decades of efforts by governments and development institutions. Large electricity subsidies continue to burden governments, especially in the Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. Reviews by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund on outcomes of their own engagement also conclude that progress on cost recovery in supported countries has been limited. Although the aggregated view obscures fluctuation within individual countries over time, the available evidence suggests that countries progressing toward cost recovery may find themselves backsliding within a few years. As for understanding the circumstances under which progress can be made, a handful of studies point toward a correlation between sector reforms and cost recovery, although few of the studies address obvious endogeneity problems. To provide more solid guidance for future efforts to improve cost recovery, more research is needed on: (i) the determinants and enabling conditions of progress on cost recovery; (ii) tariff reform sequencing; and (iii) institutional arrangements, policies, and regulations that enable countries to sustain cost recovery once it is reached.",2017,1/25/2023 12:46,1/25/2023 12:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 8287",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,130

It is widely known that they produce not only desirable (good) outputs (e.g., electricity) but also undesirable (bad) outputs (e.g., CO""2) as a result of their plant operations. The proposed approach incorporates an output separation (desirable and undesirable outputs) for the performance evaluation of energy firms. In addition to the output separation, this study separates inputs into energy and non-energy inputs. Consequently, the proposed approach incorporates not only the output separation but also the input separation within a computational framework of DEA non-radial measurement. This study compares the proposed approach with other previous DEA approaches used for the performance evaluation of energy firms. After the methodological comparison, this study applies the proposed approach for measuring the unified efficiency of Japanese fossil fuel power generation. This empirical study confirms that the implementation of Kyoto Protocol (2005) has not been effective on the unified efficiency of Japanese fossil fuel power generation during the observed period (2004-2008).

These factors are compared to similar characteristics of the countries with existing nuclear power programs using a series of quantitative indicators. While all five countries have strong motivations to develop nuclear power, which result from the high growth rates in demand for electricity and energy security concerns, their financial and institutional capacities to deploy nuclear energy vary and are generally lower than in those countries which already operate nuclear power plants.

This dissertation assesses the impact of the Argentinean reforms in electricity on transmission efficiency. It then goes beyond the Argentinean case and analyzes some regulatory issues affecting transmission. Chapter 2 shows that the Argentinean reforms increased reliability and brought prices closer to costs. However, regulatory fine-tuning is required to ensure sustainability. Chapter 3 examines the impact of unbundling on the construction of the transmission link to the Yacyreta generation complex. A long-term commercial contract in an unbundled industry allowed competition to reduce investment cost and facilitated better monitoring by outsiders. Chapter 4 analyzes investment procedures in the context of the proposal to build a fourth line in the Comahue corridor. While procedures are mostly coherent, some rules appear to distort incentives to expand. The narrow definition of beneficiaries limits the number of participants in the decision-making. Grid users' limited accountability reduces incentives to pay for expansion. Long term contracts could increase the cost of the constraints for the party with the obligation to deliver. Chapter 5 analyzes incentives to promote grid expansion under uncertain demand using a single period-single generator model. The monopolist underinvests in comparison to an unconstrained system to reduce the likelihood of having to pay for unutilized capacity, under lower than expected demand. Optimal transmission capacity is monotonically decreasing in the cost of capital, and weakly increasing in the probability of experiencing high demand. Two possible equilibrium values for grid capacity are identified, associated with the rationing prices for either low or high demand. Chapter 6 analyzes the Laffont/Tirole model of monopoly regulation under constrained capacity and asymmetric cost information. It studies short-term implications of insufficient capacity on the efficiency of regulatory incentives to promote cost efficient behavior. Under complete information cost reduction efforts remain constant when the monopolist produces at capacity. With information asymmetries effort is strictly monotonic with respect to the firm's efficiency parameter, even at full capacity. Second best efforts are uniformly less than first best.",2001,1/25/2023 12:49,2023-03-03 08:25:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,Boston University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Economics of Regulation L51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,143

Today biomass in all its forms (wood, dung, and agricultural and forest residues) supplies about 14 percent of our energy - most of it in developing countries, where biomass is the most common energy source. Biomass provides more than a quarter of China's energy, for example. Rural areas in most developing countries depend heavily on biomass for energy. A dearth of biomass energy usually indicates other developmental and envi ronmental problems. The difficulty in trying to ameliorate such problems is that bioenergy may not be a priority for local communities, which have more pressing problems or are unable to take the longer-term view toward rehabilitating their biomass resources. But outside energy experts tend to focus on one aspect of biomass use to the exclusion of all others, and therefore many biomass energy projects and programs fail. The author presents case studies showing that local involvement and control is a prerequisite for the success of such programs. There is an enormous untapped potential for biomass, and bioenergy systems may be less irreversibly damaging to the environment than conventional fossil fuels. Bioenergy systems produce many but mostly local and relatively small impacts on the environment and their impact is more controllable. There is no short-cut, however, to long-term planning and development of biomass energy systems. And the barriers are many: economic, social, and technological. Modernizing biomass technologies, for example - so biomass can be used for liquid fuel, electricity, and gas (in addition to its traditional use as a heat source) - involves land use issues that make implementation of biomass projects more difficult than projects involving more centralized energy resources. But both traditional and modernizied biomass energy systems need developing to produce preferred forms such as heat, electricity, and liquids. Biomass energy should be modernized more rapidly, and at the same time traditional biomass fuels should be produced and used as efficiently as possible - both in a sustainable manner.",1992,1/25/2023 12:52,1/25/2023 12:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: The World Bank, Policy Research Working Paper Series: 968",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,146

We observe that prevailing evaluation methods for natural gas efficiency programs value avoided firm pipeline capacity based on its total ('gross') cost. We propose, consistent with deregulated electricity markets, to value avoided firm pipeline capacity at its 'net' cost. Specifically, we account for revenues associated with selling excess capacity during periods when the firm capacity holder does not fully utilize its rights. Our evaluation of commercial building efficiency programs suggests that prevailing evaluation methods could over-estimate the value of efficiency programs when those programs are intended to offset new capacity investments (i.e., the utility is in need of additional firm capacity). The situation is more complex for a utility with sufficient firm pipeline capacity to meet forecast load (i.e., consumption). In this case, the prevailing evaluation methods have the potential to under- or over-estimate the value of efficiency programs. The value of avoided infrastructure investments is likely to vary with the specific circumstances of the utility and the expected revenues associated with short-term sales enabled by available capacity. In the future, we recommend that economic regulators of natural gas distribution utilities, the state public utility commissions (PUCs), value avoided infrastructure investments at the 'net' cost of the investment instead of the 'gross' cost.",2018-02,1/25/2023 12:31,1/25/2023 12:31,,101-110,,,50.0,,Utilities Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Energy: Demand and Supply; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Prices Q41; Capacity D24; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Cost; Production",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,147

In this dissertation, I analyze two policies that can resolve the death spiral problem. The first policy involves levying an option charge on consumers for the right to use the grid when their DG devices are not generating enough electricity. The other policy involves using smart meters to charge retail consumers different per unit prices in different demand periods. My theoretical results show that these two policies can resolve the death spiral problem and my simulation results confirm that the option charge and variable pricing indeed resolve a death spiral situation that I simulate for the case of California.

Although the current literature hold more negative views about FTRs, this paper presents a simple illustrative 2-stage model to study the competitive behaviors of electricity generators and load serving entities (LSEs) and analyzes the welfare effects of FTRs in the restructuring U.S. wholesale power market framework. The analysis focuses on a competitive two-node electricity network model where there is one generator and one LSE in each node with linear marginal cost and demand function, supervised by an independent system operator (ISO). In the first-stage of modelling, a no-rights benchmark model is developed to solve for the optimal quantity of power production and consumption and derive the locational marginal price for each node, which serve as the building blocks to solve for the optimal FTR hedge positions in the second-stage model. Once a stochastic parameter shock is introduced, the second-stage model shows that the acquisition of optimal FTRs by the risk averse generators and LSEs increases and in general strictly increases the social welfare compared with the case where there is no FTRs available. This result provides a counterexample to the somewhat negative views about FTRs held by other economists in the literature and provides some economic explanations to the fact that FTRs are widely adopted as a financial hedge instrument in the major U.S. wholesale power markets.",2005,1/25/2023 12:51,1/25/2023 12:51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: Iowa State University, Department of Economics, Staff General Research Papers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,153

While important advances have been made in the provision of clean cooking on the one hand, and there have been heightened efforts to increase rates of electrification throughout the world on the other, the two policy objectives are often not integrated, despite the overlapping health, environmental and economic benefits of doing so. Energy policy often overlooks electric cooking as part of broader electrification strategies and forecasts, while clean cooking advocates often omit electrification from their initiatives. This means significant progress in meeting cooking needs through electrification is not being achieved. Hence, although SDG7's aims of universal access to electricity and clean cooking fuels and technologies are intertwined, and provide overlapping health, environment, and economic benefits, energy policy around these two goals remains disconnected. Drawing on interviews with practitioners and researchers and informed by a review of relevant academic and grey literature, we explore how political economy analysis can shed light on this mutual neglect by providing an understanding of the ways in which power, politics and governance shape the current landscape of e-cooking, but also how, when reconfigured, they have the potential to shape a pathway of greater electrification.

The authors develop a model of the firm in which electricity is produced internally, with scale economies. The model explains the observed behavior (prevalent in Nigeria, common in Indonesia, and rare in Thailand) that firms supplement their purchases of publicly produced electricity with electricity produced internally. To prepare an econometric estimate, they specify a translog model. In Nigeria, where firms exhibit excess capacity, generators are treated as a fixed input, whereas in Indonesia, where firms are expanding, they are variable. They confirm strong scale economies in internal power production in both Nigeria and Indonesia. Shadow price analysis for both countries shows that smaller firms would pay much more for public power than larger firms would.

The applicability of the U.S. experience to the European Community is questioned because of the very different regulatory histories of the United States and Europe. The paper concludes that the ""open access"" trend in the United States has stemmed from the need to patch up the results of previous regulatory errors; and though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) may have helped relieve certain short-term problems by championing open access, it may have created long-term problems that are disguised by the current gas glut.

The current paper comes up with a new proposal, called H-R-G-V, which blends the two traditions and is shown in simulations to apply well to electricity transmission pricing and investment. In particular, it induces immediately optimal pricing/investment but is not based on subsidies. In the transmission application, the H-R-G-V approach is based on a bilevel optimization with the transmission company (Transco) at the top and the independent system operator (ISO) at the bottom level.

The current paper, using firm-level data collected by a business environment assessment survey in 26 countries in Europe and Central Asia, estimates the marginal impacts on firm costs of infrastructure quality. The results suggest that the reliability or continuity of services is important for business performance. Firm costs significantly increase when electricity outages occur more frequently and the average outage duration becomes longer. Similarly, increased hours of water supply suspensions also reduce firms' competitiveness. In these countries, it is found that the total benefit for the economy from eliminating the existing electricity outages ranges from 0.5 to 6 percent of gross domestic product. If all water suspensions are removed, the economy could receive a gain of about 0.5 to 2 percent of gross domestic product.

We use this framework to understand the role of electricity transmission integrating a high share of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) and investigate the optimal generation mix consisting of wind and solar for Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM). For the same level of risk, we find that the average capacity factor of VRE could be 7% higher if transmission constraints are alleviated. Our results show that in order to minimise the risks of a VREdominated generation portfolio, transmission capacity and efficient access will become very important--at a high level of VRE penetration in NEM, a marginal increase in transmission capacity reduces system risks associated with wind and solar uncertainties by ca. 0.25 p.p. Lack of transmission capacity therefore implies potentially greater risks to VRE generators and hence higher energy costs at high levels of VRE penetration. Using our proposed approach (residual demand minimisation), which accounts for the dynamics of electricity generation associated with wind and solar as well as with demand, we find investment in solar generation is rewarded more than when using an output maximisation approach that ignores patterns of demand. For example, on average, solar share reaches 15.4% under the residual demand minimisation approach versus 12.5% under output maximisation approach. Investment in solar is also sensitive to the way we formulate our risk objective, being less favourable if we consider only peak hours than if we consider all hours. Further, our results suggest that wind generation and transmission capacity expansion are complements NEMwide while solar generation and wind generation are complements within the same region.",2020,1/25/2023 12:38,1/25/2023 12:38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: Faculty of Economics, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Working Papers in Economics",,,,Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy L98; Programming Models; Investment Decisions G11; Portfolio Choice; Mathematical and Simulation Modeling: General C60; Mathematical Methods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,165

Through content analysis of the online data provided by these companies, we found that most products in Germany and France rely on Scandinavian hydropower. Since almost all of these plants have been operating for decades, these products today cannot be said to effectively drive new renewable capacities. Products in the UK and Italy rely on sources which already have state-led support and thus also do not drive the expansion of renewables. In fact, none of the four countries has established a policy framework that successfully fosters the development of a voluntary market for green electricity capable of driving the expansion of renewables.

We assess the relationship between the level of competition in electricity and fixed telephony markets in EU countries and evaluate the affordability of these services for different socio-educational layers. Our findings show that--although in countries where there is a relatively high frequency of switching, inequalities between socio-educational groups are smaller and eventually disappear--competition as such does not play a part.

This policy mix has been subject to strong criticism. It is mainly argued that RES-E schemes contribute nothing to emissions reduction and undermine the cost-effectiveness of the EU ETS. Consequently, many scholars suggest the abolition of RES-E schemes. However, this conclusion rests on quite narrow and unrealistic assumptions about the design and performance of markets and policies. This article provides a systematic and comprehensive review and discussion of possible rationales for combining the EU ETS with RES-E support schemes. The first and most important reason may be restrictions to technology development and adoption. These may be attributed to the failure of markets as well as policies, and more generally to the path dependency in socio-technical systems. Under these conditions, RES-E schemes are required to reach sufficient levels of technology development. In addition, it is highlighted that in contrast to the EU ETS RES-E support schemes may provide benefits beyond mitigating climate change.",2013-01,1/25/2023 12:40,1/25/2023 12:40,,597-607,,1,52.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Energy: Demand and Supply; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Prices Q41; Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy L98; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Environmental Economics: Government Policy Q58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,173

In Alberta, the Climate Leadership Plan has a number of key action points, including ""putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions . . . ending pollution from coal-generated electricity by 2030 . . . developing more renewable energy"" (Government of Alberta 2018b). Initiatives in ""consumer rebates, supply chain incentives, and innovative financing options"" can help achieve the federal and provincial targets (Advanced Energy Center 2016, 10). However, energy efficiency upgrades and renewable energy projects are major undertakings and require significant capital investments. A widely held view by environmental advisors, such as Harrington and Heart (2014), is that loans to finance such capital investments are difficult to obtain from traditional lenders. Bill 10: An Act to Enable Clean Energy Improvements was introduced in the Alberta legislature on April 12, 2018 ""to let municipalities establish a Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program that would make it more affordable for Albertans to upgrade their properties without having to put money down"" (Government of Alberta 2018a). The Alberta government lists four steps that property owners will have to take to access the PACE program. First, property owners will have to decide what clean-energy upgrade they want for their property. Second, property owners, then, sign an agreement with the municipality to repay a loan to finance the upgrade through an annual surcharge on their municipal property taxes. Third, property owners will have to find an approved contractor to carry out the upgrades. Fourth, property owners pay the loans through property taxes and ""the municipality passes that on to the lender"" (Government of Alberta 2018a). See also Jensen (2018) for a capsule summary of how PACE programs work and their pros and cons. Bill 10 passed on June 6, 2018 and the Alberta government announced that it would bring forward regulations for approval by the fall of 2018 and develop a PACE program in partnership with Energy Efficiency Alberta, an agency of the provincial government (Government of Alberta 2018a). The program ""will front the cost, using private capital from a bank or pension fund partner"" (Stolte 2018). However, as of February 2019, the government is yet to announce PACE regulations. The Bill has support in Alberta's two largest cities. While municipalities are not forced to participate in the program, Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi ""expects council to sign on to the program once it is fully fleshed out next year"" (Wood 2018). Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson also agrees that there is ""a huge pent-up demand"" for a PACE program (Stolte 2018). However, Alberta's Environment Minister Shannon Phillips believes that ""there will be enthusiasm for the program throughout Alberta, not just in Calgary and Edmonton"" (Wood 2018).

The analyses provide evidence that the probability of having a positive (negative) sign exhibits a serial dependence structure and a dependence on the load periods, as well as on past history. Based on this evidence, we build a suitable model for zonal sign dynamics, and we use it for an out-of-sample forecasting exercise concerning the probability of a positive imbalance sign, pi_{t}. The results show that the zonal imbalance sign is 'predictable.'

Eventually, the case was settled and Svenska Kraftnat offered commitments to address the Commission's concerns. As an interim remedy, it committed to reducing transmission flow of electricity on internal network bottlenecks primarily by introducing national measures and by not reducing interconnection capacity. As a final remedy, Svenska Kraftnat agreed to split the Swedish market into multiple price zones. Congestion within Sweden would then be solved by adjusting the prices of those zones. We analyse the economic effects of the alleged abuse and the remedy package. We make three observations. First, it might be socially optimal to reduce cross-border capacity in response to internal congestion. Hence, without an in-depth economic analysis the Commission risked preventing efficient behaviour. Second, the interim remedy of handling internal congestion primarily by national measures is not socially optimal, and it cannot be ruled out that it reduces overall welfare.

An intra- and inter-commodity Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is carried out in order to isolate seasonality and identify a small number of independent factors driving each commodity market. The cross-commodity correlation of the factors is estimated by a two step PCA. The factor volatilities and cross-commodity factor correlations are studied in order to identify stable parametric models, heteroskedasticity and seasonality in the factor volatilities and correlations. The model leads to explicit stochastic differential equations governing the short term and long term factors driving the price of the spot commodity under the risk neutral measure. Risk premia are absent, consistently with HJM arbitrage free framework, as they are imbedded in the factor volatilities and correlations estimated by the PCA.

Many geological, mining, technical and economic aspects should be taken in to consideration simultaneously. The assessment process is also subject to errors, including measurement and interpretation errors and errors resulting from lack of knowledge or over-optimism. Uncertainty about the true value of the geological parameters is reduced as the recognition process and the knowledge about deposits improve. Especially at the first stages of mine development, the information available is insufficient and can lead to incorrect interpretation. In this paper, the impact of geological information on key economic parameters was examined, using the example of a hard coal deposit in mine X in Poland. A scenario analysis was performed, based on a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was conducted using ogive distributions and copulas (empirical copulas) binding six geological parameters (coal and waste rock thickness, coal density, coal calorific value (LHV) and sulfur and ash content). To achieve the research purposes, the most popular economic measures (indicators), i.e., IRR, NPV and EBITDA, were used. Finally, differential distributions of these parameters were built and commented upon. The three analyzed scenarios were elaborated considering the data from the geological 3D model of coal deposit X. A polygon (testing) area was defined in the coal field, where complete geological information was available. The first data set (scenario 1) incorporated only information from deep surface boreholes (drillings), the second included data from surface drillings and channel samples and the third used only channel sampling. To interpolate the geological data between boreholes, the inverse distance interpolator was applied. Significant differences in the values of selected economic parameters were obtained; the largest in scenario 1. The average value of the IRR difference distribution (overestimation) was 6.4%; for NPV it was up to 213.7 million PLN and for EBITDA up to 678.6 million PLN in comparison to the reference scenario, or possibly even more. The results achieved are influenced by optimistic estimates of the thickness of coal partings, the amount of coal impurities and finally, lower costs of waste rock handling and coal production, despite the unfavorable values of the coal-quality parameters. The total cost of waste rock management underground and coal processing should be of special interest in the assessment process. These observations led to the general conclusion that interpretation of the geological information at the early stages of the exploration based only on surface boreholes, can lead to overestimating the potential value of the coal reserves and hence to significant errors. It is worth mentioning that the aspects of geological appraisals presented above are commented upon in the professional literature, but elaborations regarding the influence of geological information in the resource economic evaluation are very limited. To strengthen the results achieved, there is a need to continue the research and verify the results obtained on other examples of coal mines.",2019-10,1/25/2023 12:36,1/25/2023 12:36,,,,,63.0,,Resources Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels L71; Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Demand and Supply; Prices Q31; Statistical Simulation Methods: General C15; Criteria for Decision-Making under Risk and Uncertainty D81",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,181

The author argues that the level of coal consumption has had a consistently strong effect on the balance of bargaining power throughout the postwar period and that industry profits have also influenced settlements, but to a lesser extent. In recent negotiations, the most important power factor has been the sharp decline in the percentage of coal produced by mines covered by UMW contracts. In addition, not only has pre-strike stockpiling by major consumers blunted the union's strike weapon, but also the weakness of union leadership in recent years has helped to precipitate and prolong strikes. Only the evidence on the union's democratic contract ratification procedure, adopted in 1973, is mixed: although providing a slight strategic advantage to the union on occasion, it has also led to confusion at the bargaining table and contributed to the weakness of the leadership.

This paper presents the first discrete choice experiment conducted with prosumers (i.e. proactive households actively managing their electricity production and consumption) in the Netherlands. Electricity trading preferences are analyzed regarding economic, environmental, social and technological parameters, based on survey data (N = 74). The dimensions most valued by prosumers are the environmental and, to a lesser extent, economic dimensions, highlighting the key motivating roles of environmental factors. Furthermore, a majority of prosumers stated they would provide surplus electricity for free or for non-monetary compensations, especially to energy-poor households. These observed trends were more pronounced among members of energy cooperatives. This suggests that peer-to-peer energy trading can advance a socially just energy transition. Regarding policy recommendations, these findings point to the need for communicating environmental and economic benefits when marketing P2P electricity trading platforms and for technical designs enabling effortless and customizable transactions.",2021-12,1/25/2023 12:32,1/25/2023 12:32,,,,,159.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Design of Experiments: General C90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,186

We find that the decision to build additional power generation capacity was necessary and justified, and that the failure to sooner recognise the need for expansion of the country's electricity generation capacity and subsequent delays in commissioning Medupi and Kusile, likely cost the economy over R110bn in lost production.

FTRs are a special type of financial option that hedge against volatility in the cost of transporting electricity over the grid. Policy makers seek to use the prices of FTRs as market signals to incentivize efficient investment and utilization of transmission capacity. However, prices will not send the correct signals if market participants strategically use FTRs. This dissertation uses data from the Texas electricity market to test whether the prices of FTRs are efficient to achieve such goals. The auctions studied are multiunit, uniform-price, sealed-bid auctions. The first part of the dissertation studies the auctions on the spot market of the wholesale electricity industry. I derive structural empirical models to test theoretical predictions as to whether bidders fully internalize the effect of FTRs on profits into their bidding decisions. I find that bidders are learning as to how to optimally bid above marginal cost for their inframarginal capacities. The bidders also learn to bid to include FTRs into their profit maximization problem during the course of the first year. But starting from the second year, they deviated from optimal bidding that includes FTRs in the profit maximization problems. Counterfactual analysis show that the primary effect of FTRs on market outcomes is changing the level of prices rather than production efficiency. Finally, I find that in most months, the current allocations of FTRs are statistically equivalent to the optimal allocations. The second part of the dissertation studies the bidding behavior in the FTR auctions. I find that FTRs' strategic impact on the FTR purchasing behavior is significant for large bidders--firms exercising market power in the FTR auctions. Second, trader forecasts future FTR credit very accurately while large generators' forecasts of future FTR credit tends to be biased upward. Finally, The bid shading patterns are consistent with theoretical predictions and support the existence of common values.",2005,1/25/2023 12:48,1/25/2023 12:48,,,,,,,,,,,,,Texas A&M University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Auctions D44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,197

This contract sets out in detail the requirements of the operator, including the levels of service as well as infrastructure required to deliver the contracted services. Buses acquired by operators in many jurisdictions have until very recently been essentially diesel fuelled and often available from a panel approved set of buses compliant with Euro 6 standards. The predictability of the cost profiles of vehicles and associated costs of maintenance and repairs is well known and used in tendered offers. With the growing requirement of switching to a green fleet with varying timetabled transition rates, the future costs of providing bus services are going to be subject to significant unknowns. These unknowns are associated not only with the fast changing vehicle technology associated with a range of fuel sources (notably standard battery and fuel cell battery [i.e., hydrogen]), but also the impact this will have of the top-to-bottom change in the operations of bus fleets affecting operating and capital expenditure including depot infrastructure, timetabling, maintenance, labour skills and access to efficient electricity charging or hydrogen facilities. With such great uncertainty, the challenge of how to structure future contracts to allow for such volatility in cost commitments becomes of paramount importance to both the regulator and the bus operator.

The underlying rationale behind all these changes is to move from a centralized operation approach to a competitive one. That is, the understanding of power supply as a public service is being replaced by the notion that a competitive market is a more appropriate framework to supply reliable and cheap electric energy to consumers. In some cases, the aforementioned transition process has included the privatization of power utilities. This new framework requires new tools and procedures, and some of these procedures drastically differ from traditional ones. Therefore, new challenging mathematical programming and operations research problems naturally arise in this context.

This paper addresses a novel integrated problem of berth allocation and ship loader scheduling arising in CETs with new features, including the symmetrical berth layout-based rotary loading mode (SBLRLM) and deballasting restrictions. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is proposed to make joint decisions to minimize the total tardiness of all ships. By exploring the problem's decomposable structure, an exact method that relies on logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) is proposed to obtain optimal solutions. According to the problem features, the monolithic MIP formulation is decomposed into a new MIP (master problem) and a constraint programming (subproblem). Combinatorial valid inequalities are developed to enhance the master problem model and obtain a tighter lower bound. A Benders cut strengthening heuristic is developed to generate feasibility and optimality cuts to ensure efficient algorithm convergence. To evaluate the proposed method, computational experiments are conducted on a set of test instances generated based on real data collected from a major CET in northern China. The results indicate that the LBBD algorithm can optimally solve large-scale problem instances within a reasonable amount of time. The plan generated by the LBBD algorithm achieves a 51.9% reduction in ship tardiness, on average, compared to that of practical scheduling methods. By using the proposed method, the superiority of the SBLRLM in reducing deballasting delays becomes more significant as the problem scale increases. In addition, considering different working intensities, the results could also help port operators make decisions about the number of berths in the SBLRLM.",2022-08,1/25/2023 12:31,1/25/2023 12:31,,229-260,,,162.0,,Transportation Research: Part B: Methodological,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Railroads and Other Surface Transportation L92; Safety and Accidents; Transportation Noise R41; Transportation: Demand, Supply, and Congestion; Travel Time; Dynamic Analysis C61; Optimization Techniques; Programming Models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,201

The model is first used to characterize the profit-maximizing market price that a generator would like set by its bidding strategy for several hedge contract and spot sales combinations. This model is applied to bid and contract data obtained from the first three months of operation of the National Electricity Market (NEM1) in Australia. This analysis illustrates the sensitivity of expected profit-maximizing bidding strategies to the amount of financial hedge contracts held by the generating unit owner.

Under the given circumstances, this article seeks to present the current fiscal regimes for the exploration and production activities in Brazil, their particularities and scope of application, as well as to initiate a brief discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the changes recently undertaken by the Brazilian government in its regulatory framework.",2018-08,1/25/2023 12:35,1/25/2023 12:35,,620-647,,,119.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Economic Development: Agriculture; Energy; Environment; Natural Resources; Other Primary Products O13; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Hydrocarbon Resources Q35; Nonrenewable Resources and Conservation: Government Policy Q38; Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Housing; Infrastructure O18; Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Development O23; Fiscal Policy E62",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,211

In Chapter 1 I briefly review the literature of Global Warming and point out that although Global Warming appears to be occurring, there is a large degree of uncertainty regarding its cause, effect and extent. In Chapter 2 I review the current usage of coal in the United States and throughout the world. In Chapter 3 I examine negative externalities (pollutions) from coal, and the costs they impose on society. In Chapter 4 I look at Clean Coal technologies and compare them with conventional technologies based on total costs (inclusive of externality costs of pollutants), and conclude that the optimal approach to deploy Clean Coal technologies should be a ""staggered refreshing"" approach, that is, to gradually replace current aging facilities with ones equipped with Clean Coal technologies. I also identify a puzzle that a high percentage of current coal-fired power plants are operating beyond their life expectance. In Chapter 5 I identify two obstacles that have prevented and will potentially prevent large-scale deployment of Clean Coal technologies: the New Source Review program under the Clean Air Act and the upcoming regulation of greenhouse gases. In Chapter 6 I analyze, from a Public Choice perspective, the forces that created these obstacles, and trace them back to the rent-seeking activities from interest groups. I conclude by making Public Choice compatible recommendations for policy reform in Chapter 7.",2010-04,1/25/2023 12:47,1/25/2023 12:47,,,,,,,,,,,,,George Mason University,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,"Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels L71; Climate; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Air Pollution; Hazardous Waste; Noise; Recycling Q53; Solid Waste; Water Pollution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,212

In critical dialogue with other attempts to theorize and implement a right to energy, we propose that it is possible to theorize a human right to electricity access from the perspective of social groups, experiences, and worldviews from the Global South. To support this claim, we present the case study of Luz y Fuerza del Pueblo, a social movement operating in the state of Chiapas, southeastern Mexico. We show that this organization's understanding of and approach to electricity depends on the convergence of Mayan cosmovisiones (worldviews) and Christian views mediated by Liberation Theology. Members conceive electricity as both a part of the whole and a fundamental entitlement that should not become marketable or be linked to capital accumulation. Moreover, the movement presents a non-hierarchical structure, has a strong commitment to territory control, an anti-capitalist attitude, a keen focus on cooperation, and implements ""politics of place"". We argue that both the worldview and the type of socio-political arrangement of Luz y Fuerza del Pueblo as well as the lived experience of its members suggest the possibility of theorizing a specific right to electricity access. Overall, our findings and proposal can benefit energy scholars and practitioners who are interested in exploring, defining, implementing and enforcing a specific right to electricity in more pluralistic and inclusive ways.",2021-05,1/25/2023 12:33,1/25/2023 12:33,,,,,75.0,,Energy Research and Social Science,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Energy: Government Policy Q48; Political Processes: Rent-seeking, Lobbying, Elections, Legislatures, and Voting Behavior D72; Economics of Minorities, Races, Indigenous Peoples, and Immigrants; Non-labor Discrimination J15; Economic Development: Human Resources; Human Development; Income Distribution; Migration O15; Formal and Informal Sectors; Institutional Arrangements O17; Shadow Economy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,213

Anaerobic digestion represents a possible benefit to farmers by reducing odor while producing methane for electricity. However, current digester designs are for herd sizes of 300 or more cows, with significant economies of scale, so smaller operators may have little interest in the technology. Moreover, without a favorable policy environment and reliable grant programs, the initial investments required for digester installation might deter operators. One solution to these issues may be community digesters, which are centrally located facilities that accept manure from multiple farms. Data from a survey of New York dairy farmers were used to assess farmers' interest in community digesters. In general, interest was associated with power generation outcomes and reservations about organic farming practices; advocates might encourage their use among smaller conventional farm operators looking for new sources of profit and diversification.",2010,1/25/2023 12:40,1/25/2023 12:40,,461-474,,4,27.0,,Agriculture and Human Values,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Agricultural Extension Services Q16; Agricultural R&D; Agricultural Technology; Biofuels; Micro Analysis of Farm Firms, Farm Households, and Farm Input Markets Q12; Agribusiness Q13; Agricultural Markets and Marketing; Cooperatives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,214

To improve its integration, the recent regulation of the European Union introduces a common standalone balancing energy market. It allows actors that have not participated or not been awarded in the preceding balancing capacity market to participate as voluntary bidders or 'second-chance' bidders. We investigate the effect of these changes on balancing market efficiency and on strategic behavior in particular, using a combination of agent-based modelling and reinforcement learning. This paper is the first to model agents' interdependent bidding strategies in the balancing capacity and energy markets with the help of two collaborative reinforcement learning algorithms. Results reveal considerable efficiency gains in the balancing energy market from the introduction of voluntary bids even in highly concentrated markets while offering a new value stream to providers of short-term flexibility. 'Second-chance' bidders further drive competition, reducing balancing energy costs. However, we warn that this design change is likely to shift some of the activation costs to the balancing capacity market where agents are prompted to bid more strategically in the view of lower profits from balancing energy. As it is unlikely that the balancing capacity market can be removed altogether, we recommend integrating European balancing capacity markets on par with balancing energy markets and easing prequalification requirements to ensure sufficient competition.",2021-11,1/25/2023 12:33,1/25/2023 12:33,,,,,158.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy L98; Market Design D47; Computational Techniques; Simulation Modeling C63,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,215

Bhutan and Nepal together have an economically feasible potential of 60,000 MW of hydroelectric power generation capacity but are too weak financially to bear alone the risks associated with the development of their hydro resources. India is the only potential market for the electricity supplied from these sources. The power purchase agreement framework for the 336 MW Chukha Hydel Project in Bhutan could serve as a model with regards to the transfer of risks, management of risks, and sourcing of finance in exchange for the sharing of the economic rents associated with such projects. India undertook the costs and risks of constructing the hydroelectric dam and power plant in exchange for a reduced purchase price of electricity from the completed facility. This paper contains a financial and economic assessment of the Chukha Hydel Project. While India is in a position to exercise monopsonic power in this electricity market, this analysis shows that it is possible to have an agreement for sharing of the risks and returns between India and the Himalayan countries that is highly beneficial to all the stakeholders.",2008,1/25/2023 12:53,1/25/2023 12:53,,25 pages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: Queen's University, Department of Economics, Working Papers: 1203",,,,Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Project Evaluation; Social Discount Rate H43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,216

A stronger institutional framework would facilitate identification and elimination of anti-competitive behaviour, such as hard-core cartels. Efforts to inject effective competition into a range of network industries have been broadly successful, but specific measures could increase competition in several sectors, such as retail and construction. There is also room to boost competition in Swedenâ€™s large and decentralised public sector and in its interactions with the private sector, so that competitive neutrality applies to all public sector activities.",2004,1/25/2023 12:52,2/28/2023 12:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: OECD Economics Department, OECD Economics Department Working Papers: 388",,,,"Comparison of Public and Private Enterprises and Nonprofit Institutions; Contracting Out L33; Privatization; Antitrust Law K21; Publicly Provided Goods: General H40; Public Enterprises; Public-Private Enterprises L32; Horizontal Anticompetitive Practices L41; Monopolization; Legal Monopolies and Regulation or Deregulation L43; Industry Studies: Transportation and Utilities: General L90; Market Structure, Firm Strategy, and Market Performance: General L10; Antitrust Policy and Public Enterprises, Nonprofit Institutions, and Professional Organizations L44; Economywide Country Studies: Europe O52; Industry Studies: Services: General L80",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,217

In this article, I intend to discuss the political and institutional dynamics by which GPNs evolve, and the capacity of states to shape emerging organizational and spatial arrangements in dynamic GPNs. Building on assemblage thinking, I conceptualize these political and institutional dynamics as the unbundling of legal, regulatory and institutional components of nation-state authorities that govern GPNs, and the subsequent reassembling of these components through emerging interactions with finance, technology and new forms of private authority. These emerging global assemblages are both partially embedded in global cities and stretch across and within the borders of nation-states. Building on this conceptual framework, this article explains how the exclusive nation-state authorities that traditionally governed liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade and markets are becoming unbundled. The article focuses on the initiatives of public and private actors in Singapore who are attempting to shape evolutionary dynamics in GPNs by establishing a hub for LNG trading and speculative financing in Asia. The article finds that Singapore's capacity to shape LNG production networks is dependent upon the capacity of public and private actors in Singapore to establish cross-border connectivity to markets in Southeast Asia.",2020-09,1/25/2023 12:31,1/25/2023 12:31,,1241-1262,,5,20.0,,Journal of Economic Geography,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Mining, Extraction, and Refining: Hydrocarbon Fuels L71; Hydrocarbon Resources Q35; Contracts and Reputation; Networks L14; Transactional Relationships; International Business F23; Multinational Firms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,218

A total of 48 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with community, industry and government representatives were performed in 2015. This research finds that network operators are perceived as 'pushing back' on distributed generation by increasing the complexity, cost and unreliability of connection applications, by restricting further connection of distributed generation to the network, and by requiring consumers to invest in technology for grid protection. Interview respondents suggest network operators do this because: distributed generation creates technical issues at the distribution-scale of the network; distributed generation can reduce financial revenue for the network operator; as a response to a lack of strategic direction on how network operators should respond to distributed generation; and due to a 'risk averse' engineering culture that rejects the unknown. Government intervention may be required to direct network operators to address technical implications of increased distributed generation and redevelop tariff models to allow fair cost recovery of network assets. However, government intervention may lead to adverse outcomes, including in relation to the cost-recovery of state-owned assets.",2017-11,1/25/2023 12:35,1/25/2023 12:35,,422-433,,,110.0,,Energy Policy,,,,,,,,,,,eoh,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Electric Utilities L94; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,1,0,220
